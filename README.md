# Regent

Regent is a web application framework written in Node.js (v8.9.0 LTS). Drawing
inspiration from the immensely popular Laravel framework, Regent is intended as
a simple yet full-featured platform for application development. Regent takes
care of the tedium of configuration, routing, caching, and all the other
low-level tasks so you can focus on the fun parts: creating great applications.
